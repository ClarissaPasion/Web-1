       <p> Growing up in the small rural community of Brookfield, Nova Scotia,<em><strong> Clarissa </strong></em> had an interest in art from a very young age. She mainly enjoys drawing and painting, has dabbled in sewing and papercrafts, but she is always excited to explore new methods and media. Clarissa is a recent graduate of St. Francis Xavier University (Class of 2024) with a major in Sociology and a minor in Studio Art. She won the graduate class prize in Art History. She is excited to continue to enhance her artistic skills in the Graphic Design program at NSCC.Although unsure where she may end up in terms of her career, something her time at NSCC may help with, Clarissa has always had an inkling to teach. Maybe somewhere in the distant future she can take what she’s learned and the experience  she’s gained and pass it along as an art educator. Aside from her creative   endeavours, Clarissa enjoys going to the beach, dancing to live music with her friends and trying new foods! She is kind and outgoing, and excited for her bright future ahead.</p>
