           The <strong>axolotl</strong> is a paedomorphic salamander. Unlike other amphibians it reaches adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis and instead of taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and gilled. Axolotls have the ability to regenerate limbs, gills and parts of their eyes and brains. This ability to regenerate may decline with age, but it does not disappear. Axolotls keep modestly growing throughout their life and some consider this trait to be a direct contributor to their regenerative abilities
           <br>
           <br>Axolotls were originally found in several lakes underlying what is currently Mexico City. Much of the axolotl's natural habitat was destroyed by Spanish settlers who drained many of those lakes after the conquest of the Aztec Empire. Urbanization and consequent water pollution in Mexico City, as well as the introduction of invasive species such as tilapia and perch has landed axolotls on the list of critically endangered species in the wild, with a decreasing population of around 50 to 1,000 adult individuals, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Axolotls were also sold as food in Mexican markets and were a staple in the Aztec diet.

        <h4>What do axolotls eat?</h4>
        <p>The axolotl is carnivorous and typically consumes small prey. They locate their food by smell then "snap" at their potential victims, sucking food into their stomachs with vacuum force.<br>Their diet commonly includes:</p>
